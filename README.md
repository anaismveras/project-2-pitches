7. Example of how to call/invoke your API, and a description of what data comes back.
     - For Searched Animals by zipCode
          ``` js
          // For Searched Animals by zipCode
               app.get('/:location', (req, res) => {
               //will make the call after user puts in zipCode
               let animalsUrl = 'https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals/${location}';

          axios.get(animalsUrl).then(apiRes => {
               let animals = apiRes.animals
          res.render('locationDetail', {animals});
               })
          }); 
          ```
     - To see information of Favorited Animal
          ```js
               router.get('/:id', (req, res)=> {
               let favePetInfo => req.params.id 
               let animalUrl = https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals/${id}

          axios.get(animalUrl)
               .then(apiRes => {
                    let petImage = apiRes.animal.photos.medium
                    let petStatus = apiRes.animal.status
                    let petName = apiRes.animal.name
                    let petAge = apiRes.animal.age
                    let petBreed = apiRes.animal.breeds.primary
                    let petGender = apiRes.animal.gender
                    let petDescrption = apiRes.animal.description

          res.render('faveDetail', {petImage, petStatus, petName, petAge, petBreed, petGender, petDescrption})
          })
          .catch(error => {
          console.log(error)
               })
          }) 

          ```
     - Information comeback:
          - For Searched Animals by zipCode - all animals on petfinder API that is in that zip code with the disalibily === true
          - To see information of Favorited Animal - Animal's searched in API by id selected and pet's Image, Adoptablity status, Name, Age(young, adult, senoir), Breed, Gender and a Descrption 

8. MVP goals (x3-5)
     - Have users press a button to sign up/login and be put/aknowledged into a data base
     - Have users search by city name show pets in that area
     - Have users be able to press a button to favorite a pet to be added to a "favorite pets" list
     - Have users see their "favorite pets" list and be able to remove animals and see more about an animal by clicking the name
     - Use API call to show animal information

9. Stretch goals (x2-5)
     - Show ONLY animals with disabilities
     - Have User be able to go to the adoption agency website

10. Any potential roadblocks?
     - Not being able to ONLY show special needs pets since in the API it shows as a boolean
     - Not being able to get the API to get the write information for the pet
     - Not being able to get the CSS to look right
